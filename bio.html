    <p> Hi, I’m Inés!</p>

    <p> I was born Peru and lived there until I was 18. My ambitions as a kid were to help prevent climate change, so I was planning to study engineering in university to work in renewable energy. But in high school, a friend convinced me to join the debate club with her, and I became an annoying debate kid for a while—I competed internationally as part of the national debate team for three years, which culminated in being octofinalists at the 2018 World Schools Debate Championship my senior year.</p>

    <p> During my "debate career", I became convinced that not only climate change, but most societal issues were actually political problems rather than engineering problems—we have the technology, but not the political will to use it. I also enrolled in a program at my school which took up about half of my school hours (alongside IB physics, economics, and math)—a project-based, interdisciplinary curriculum created by three creative teachers that encouraged students to question their education and the “default path”. As a result of this, I went through a phase of not wanting to go to university, and just generally having a life crisis so bad that the same aforementioned friend (who was also having her own crisis) and I started a “philosophy club” at our high school to work it out. </p>

    <p> Eventually, I decided to study liberal arts in New York due to my lack of a better post-high school plan that did not involve university, as well as a romantic and semi-radical vision for what higher-level education should look like. I took some classes in politics (and was very far left for a while) and some in computer science, and I realized I really liked both. One day towards the end of my sophomore year, I was researching masters programs and realized that for almost all of the ones that interested me, a liberal arts degree from a non-research institution that barely offered any STEM classes wasn’t going to cut it. I decided to transfer to study computational social science in Ireland—a decision I am really glad I made, because I hadn’t even heard about t-tests until then. </p>

    <p> This was mid-2020. I flew to Ireland along with my best friend who I was secretly in love with, who was also transferring from that college after a gap year. Our Irish universities promised us that everything would be “hybrid”, but predictably, everything shut down promptly after we arrived, and we had to go back home. Around this time, my mom had been having a midlife crisis and moved to a friend’s house in rural Italy, so I spent the pandemic there with her, slowly going insane. </p> 

    <p> In 2021, I stumbled upon the effective altruism introductory fellowship online, and decided to enroll because, well, I was in a farm in Italy and had nothing better to do. I had heard about effective altruism before, but it didn’t resonate with me because I thought it was too focused on the marginal individual as opposed to systemic change. However, when I read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout_PlayPump" target="_blank">PlayPump</a>, it immediately clicked for me and I felt a bit silly for not having thought of it myself—<i>of course</i> we should focus on impact and cost-effectiveness when trying to improve the world, and also, I <i>am</i> the marginal individual. For the first time, I felt like there was a non-clout-related reason to pursue “career capital”, as <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#why-career-capital-is-so-important">80,000 hours convinced me</a> that it was instrumental to ending up in a position to improve the world (and again felt silly for not having seen the value of this before). </p>

    <p> I spent that summer as a research assistant at The UBI Center, where I wrote a research piece that was presented to a group of UK MPs. The next summer I was in Berkeley helping run the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative’s summer research fellowship. This year I am doing a six-month work placement at Deloitte, where I work with the actuarial team as well as the valuation and modeling team (AKA the “quants”). On the side, I have also helped run the EA Ireland group, wrote an article about Peru that was featured on Marginal Revolution, won a medal for best sociology essay at my university for a data science project on Covid-19 "spreading" on Wikipedia, and volunteered doing research for EA organizations SoGive and ALLFED. </p>

     <p>I am not sure how to conclude this because, well, my life is still ongoing. I am currently feeling a little bit burnt out and am planning on taking it easy this summer with my girlfriend (yes, the girl from before) in California, and will probably be applying to masters programs in September. Thanks for reading!</p>
