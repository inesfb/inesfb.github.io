    <p> Hi, I’m Inés!</p>

    <p> I was born Peru and lived there until I was 18. My ambitions as a kid were to help prevent climate change, so I was planning to study engineering in university and work in renewable energy. But in high school, a friend convinced me to join the debate club with her, and after becoming a debate kid—I competed internationally as part of the national debate team for three years—I became convinced this and most other societal issues were actually political problems rather than engineering ones. </p>

    <p> Around the same time, I also enrolled in an interdisciplinary program at my school which took up about half of my school hours (along some IB classes) created by three dissident teachers that encouraged students to question the education system and the “default path”. As a result of this, I went through a phase of not wanting to go to university, and the same aforementioned friend (who was also having her own crisis) and I started a “philosophy club” at our high school to work it out. </p>

    <p> Eventually, I decided to study liberal arts in New York due to my romantic vision of what higher-level education should look like. In addition to my classes in politics, I took some in computer science, and really liked both. One day towards the end of my sophomore year, I was researching masters programs and realized that for almost all of the ones that interested me, a liberal arts degree from a non-research institution wasn’t going to cut it. I decided to transfer and study computational social science in Ireland—a decision I am really glad I made, because I hadn’t even heard about t-tests until then. </p>

    <p> This was mid-2020. I flew to Ireland along with my best friend who I was secretly in love with, who was also transferring from that college after a gap year. Our Irish universities promised us that everything would be “hybrid”, but everything shut down promptly after we arrived, and we had to go back home. Around this time, my mom had been having a midlife crisis and moved to a friend’s house in rural Italy, so I spent the pandemic there with her. </p> 

    <p> During lockdown, I stumbled upon the effective altruism introductory fellowship online, and decided to enroll. When I read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout_PlayPump" target="_blank">PlayPump</a>, it immediately clicked for me and I felt a bit silly for not having thought of EA myself. For the first time, I felt like there was a non-clout-related reason to pursue “career capital”, as <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#why-career-capital-is-so-important">it is really useful</a> to ending up in a position to improve the world. </p>

    <p> I spent that summer as a research assistant at The UBI Center, where I wrote a research piece that was presented to a group of UK MPs. The next summer I was in Berkeley helping run the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative’s summer research fellowship. This year I did a six-month work placement at Deloitte, where I worked with the actuarial team as well as the quants. On the side, I have also helped run the EA Ireland group with a grant from the Centre for Effective Altruism, wrote an article about Peru that was featured on Marginal Revolution, won a medal for best sociology essay at my university for a data science project on Covid-19 "spreading" on Wikipedia, and volunteered doing research for EA organizations SoGive and ALLFED. </p>

     <p>I am not sure how to conclude this because, well, my life is still ongoing. Thanks for reading!</p>
